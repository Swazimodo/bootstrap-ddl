# bootstrap-ddl
Bootstrap-DDL gives you a replacement for the select option elements that is fully stylable. You also have additional features like support for multiline items or word wrapping. Traditionally these features would be unavailable and your extra content would just be truncated if an option exceeded the width of the control.

With this library you can set the display text to go into the input box once an item is selected. This display text can be different then the conent of the option. Seems how the option can render full HTML you could have a bolded title and then a description for an option without issue.
